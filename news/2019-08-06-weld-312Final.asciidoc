Weld 3.1.2.Final is coming along with Weld API 3.1.SP1. It is another small release bringing in mainly bugfixes.
One notable thing is that thanks to guys from Jetty, Weld 3.1.2.Final is ready to operate with lastest Jetty 9 as well as upcoming Jetty 10.
Other than that we have tried to address some dodgy issues with possible race conditions and leaks - see for yourself!

Fixes and improvements:

* Weld API/SPI
** Fixed possible leak in Jandex index through `SimpleServiceRegistry` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2592[WELD-2592, window="_blank"])
*** This could only happen on application server supporting Jandex index and was only noticeable with a lot of application deployed at the same time

* Weld Core
** Fixed a case where some context event notification wouldn't trigger observers due to race condition (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2557[WELD-2557, window="_blank"])
** Fixed rare `IllegalAccessError` problem during interception when methods had (package) private parameters from different methods (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2583[WELD-2583, window="_blank"])
*** Such methods are now automatically ignored when creating intercepted subclasses
** Attempted to fix a race condition that could happen when trying to concurrently initiate conversation ID generator (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2585[WELD-2585, window="_blank"])
** Weld now correctly disregards synthetic methods when considering proxyability (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2586[WELD-2586, window="_blank"])
** Correction to `beans.xml` parses when using Weld namespace (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2591[WELD-2591, window="_blank"])

* Weld SE
** Improved classpath scanning to account for manifest file entries (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2589[WELD-2589, window="_blank"])
** `javax.enterprise.inject.scan.implicit=true` and `org.jboss.weld.se.archive.isolation=false` now work together correctly (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2590[WELD-2590, window="_blank"])

* Weld Servlet
** Update Weld to new Jetty integration model prior to Jetty release (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2587[WELD-2587, window="_blank"])
*** Weld 3.1.2.Final is ready to roll with to-be-released Jetty 9.4.x as well as Jetty 10.x
*** Of course we also kept legacy support in place, so even older version will still run
