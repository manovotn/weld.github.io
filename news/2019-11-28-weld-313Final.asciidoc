Weld 3.1.3.Final arrives along with Weld API 3.1.SP2.
This is a minor update which had a main goal of swapping whole Weld internals from Java EE 8 to Jakarta EE 8.

Fixes and improvements:

* Weld API/SPI
** API was transferred to Jakarta EE GAVs (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2598[WELD-2598, window="_blank"])

* Weld Core
** Core and whole testing was transferred to Jakarta EE GAvs (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2598[WELD-2598, window="_blank"])
** Properties inside `beans.xml` now support spec-descriptor-property-replacement on WildFly (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2600[WELD-2600, window="_blank"])
** Rolling updates delimiter is now correctly ignored for external bean archives (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2596[WELD-2596, window="_blank"])
** Allow for `private final` method in intercepted beans, these methods are then ignored during interception but Weld no longer blows up (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2595[WELD-2595, window="_blank"])

* Weld Servlet
** Adjust Jetty attributes accordingly to how they were renamed (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2597[WELD-2597, window="_blank"])

* Other
** Fix several misplaced licenses that were causing confusion (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2599[WELD-2599, window="_blank"])
