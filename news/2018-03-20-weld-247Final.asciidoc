Weld 2.4.7.Final is now available.
It includes multiple important bugfixes, many of them focused around proxy generation and/or invocation.

NOTE: Weld 2.4 now enters maintenance mode - there will be no further active development on Weld 2. We will be channeling our efforts into Weld 3 instead.

Notable fixes and improvements:

* Weld Core:
** Proxy-related issues:
*** Fixed possible NPE with multiple deployments one of which uses `relaxed construction` configuration (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2448[WELD-2448, window="_blank"])
*** `BeanManager.getInjectableReference` was using unnecessarily strict checks for proxyability (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2466[WELD-2466, window="_blank"])
*** Proxy serialization is now container agnostic (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2447[WELD-2447, window="_blank"])
*** Fix invocation of private observer method (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2443[WELD-2443, window="_blank"])
**** This only applies to private observer method which is not intercepted but is declared on a bean which has some other intercepted methods
*** Correct proxy generation for class hierarchy with abstract class and generics (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2470[WELD-2470, window="_blank"])
** Other issues:
*** Minor optimization in internal structures of `InterceptionModel` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2455[WELD-2455, window="_blank"])
*** Improve exception logging for `DeploymentException` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2453[WELD-2453, window="_blank"])
*** Prevent NPE if `ProtectionDomain.getPermissions()` returns `null` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2464[WELD-2464, window="_blank"])

* Weld SE
** Fields in `org.jboss.weld.environment.se.Weld` are now `protected` (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2451[WELD-2451, window="_blank"])
** Allow to register custom `BeanArchiveHandler` using `ServiceLoader` mechanism (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2450[WELD-2450, window="_blank"])
*** This applies to SE and Servlet environments


* Other
** With OSGi, `javax.ejb` is now imported optionally (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2458[WELD-2458, window="_blank"])
** Weld now uses SpotBugs (a successor to FindBugs) (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2462[WELD-2462, window="_blank"])
** `module-info`, if present, is now correctly ignored during bean discovery phase (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2459[WELD-2459, window="_blank"])
