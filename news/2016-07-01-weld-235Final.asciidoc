The next version of the stable 2.3 branch has been released!
See also https://issues.jboss.org/projects/WELD/versions/12330052[the release details, window="_blank"].
Thanks to everyone involved in this release!

We plan to create the *2.4 branch* of Weld within a few weeks.
Weld 2.4 will remain a *CDI 1.2* implementation.
We would like to do some cleanup (e.g. remove deprecated classes from Weld SE), enhance the API and also add some new features.
