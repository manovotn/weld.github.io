Weld 2 has entered maintenance mode with its 2.4.7.Final release earlier this year.
Now we are coming with a maintenance release containing fixes to several nuisances you might have come across.

Notable fixes and improvements:

* Weld Core:
** Opt-in enhancement in HTTP session replication, more eager approach (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-1130[WELD-1130, window="_blank"])
*** Note that WildFly does not need to use this
** `AfterTypeDiscovery` did not allow to remove declared interceptors/decorators/alternatives correctly (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2479[WELD-2479, window="_blank"])
** Corrected decorator subclass creation when said decorator overrides only default method (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2501[WELD-2501, window="_blank"])
** Avoid optimizing self invocation of private methods in order to avoid `IllegalAccessError`(link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2506[WELD-2506, window="_blank"])
** Allow interception of abstract, package-private classes with public methods (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2507[WELD-2507, window="_blank"])
** Fix interception of overriden generic methods invoked via superclass (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2514[WELD-2514, window="_blank"])
** Implement reflection fallback for qualifier loading when there are multiple instances of the class in the deployment (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2531[WELD-2531, window="_blank"])
** Fixed possible race condition appearing during bean index creation (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2532[WELD-2532, window="_blank"])

* Weld SE
** Fix NPE which could occur if trying to intercept a method called by constructor (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2473[WELD-2473, window="_blank"] and link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2478[WELD-2478, window="_blank"])


* Other
** Correction to licenses in Probe (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2480[WELD-2480, window="_blank"])
