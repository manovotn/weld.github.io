Weld 3.1.6.Final is now available and brings a dosage of bug fixes and updates with it.
Without further due, let's dive straight into it!

Fixes and improvements:

* Weld Core
** Fix for decorators operating on interfaces with default methods (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2647[WELD-2647, window="_blank"])
** Weld will no longer try to load classes for specific JDK version when using multi-release JARs (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2652[WELD-2652, window="_blank"])
** `ProxyFactory` was changed to produce more deterministic and sensible names when based off interfaces (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2618[WELD-2618, window="_blank"])
*** NOTE: this slightly changes names of generated proxy classes but has no effect on the functionality itself

* Weld Servlet
** Detect Jetty server in GWT 2.8+ test environment (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2635[WELD-2635, window="_blank"])
** Injection into Undertow servlet listener now works as intended (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2636[WELD-2636, window="_blank"])
*** This should work from Undertow 2.2.0.Final onwards

* Weld SE 
** Bean defining annotation can be specified as generic `SeContainerInitializer` property (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2639[WELD-2639, window="_blank"])

* Other bits
** Fixed issue preventing upgrade of surefire plugin in our testsuite (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2634[WELD-2634, window="_blank"])
** Several corrections to OSGi package configuration (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2642[WELD-2642, window="_blank"], link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2644[WELD-2644, window="_blank"], link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2645[WELD-2645, window="_blank"], link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2646[WELD-2646, window="_blank"])
** Re-introduce multi HTML documentation output in best-effort mode; this is mainly to keep old links working (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2640[WELD-2640, window="_blank"])
** Fix intermittent test failure in `DispatchingTest` caused by race condition (link:https://issues.jboss.org/browse/WELD-2650[WELD-2650, window="_blank"])
